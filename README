GRN-Pathways
============
Welcome to the GRN-Pathways program. This is a program to produce biological 
genetic regulatory network models from biological pathway data. Simply create 
a pathway file (see the examples in the pws folder for syntax), and run the 
program with the appropriate options to generate pathway, state space, or 
conditional distribution graphs. Also enables setting various conditions and 
knockout conditions as well. 


NB: Must have gnuplot, fftw3-dev, and graphviz installed on the PATH in order for most of the commands to work.

Installing
----------
Assuming you have Haskell installed and the appropriate prerequisites:

cabal configure
cabal build
./grnsim

Or run ./simruns (a short python script) and compare to gold.txt to make sure 
everything is running alright (I know, its a poor man's way to test, but I've 
got paper deadlines to worry about!).

Problems
--------
Just let me know if you run into any problems: Jason Knight <Jason AT
